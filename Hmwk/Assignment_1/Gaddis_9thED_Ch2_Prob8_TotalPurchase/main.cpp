 * Purpose: A customer in a store is purchasing five items. The prices of the 
 five items are: 
    Price of item 1 = $15.95 
    Price of item 2 = $24.95
    Price of item 3 = $6.95
    Price of item 4 = $12.95 
    Price of item 5 = $3.95 
 Write a program that holds the prices of the five items in five variables. 
 Display each itemâ€™s price, the subtotal of the sale, the amount of sales tax,
  and the total. Assume the sales tax is 7%
