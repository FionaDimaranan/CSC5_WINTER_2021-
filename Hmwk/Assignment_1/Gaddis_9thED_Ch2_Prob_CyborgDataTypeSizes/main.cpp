 * Purpose: You have been given a job as a programmer on a Cyborg supercomputer.
 *  In order to accomplish some calculations, you need to know how many bytes 
 * the following data types use: char, int, float, and double. You do not have 
 * any manuals, so you canâ€™t look this information up. Write a C++ program that 
 * will determine the amount of memory used by these types and display the 
 * information on the screen.
